# Showtime reference

Self-contained background for the public `showtime` skill: the completion bar, the
recurring bug classes, and the conventions you need to bring **tweakcc-fixed** (the
patcher) and its overrides repo up to a new Claude Code (CC) release without
shipping a silent downgrade or a latent crash. The skill points at the numbered
sections below; everything here is meant to be acted on by a stranger running the
tool on their **local** machine.

Two repos move together on the same release cycle:

- **tweakcc-fixed** — the patcher: regex code-patches in `src/patches/*.ts`, the
  prompt-JSON sync (`data/prompts/prompts-X.Y.Z.json`), the extractor
  (`tools/promptExtractor.js`), and the CLI/TUI.
- **the overrides repo** — the curated system-prompt overrides (`.md` files with
  frontmatter). The tweakcc README pairs the patcher with an overrides repo
  (`lobotomized-claude-code` by default); clone or symlink it where the README
  says. `~/.tweakcc/system-prompts` and `~/.tweakcc/system-reminders` are symlinks
  into that repo's active per-model override set; the patcher reads both at
  `--apply`. The `~/.tweakcc/...` layout is tweakcc's own convention.

The canonical pristine `cli.js` is `~/.tweakcc/native-claudejs-orig.js`, which the
patcher rewrites on every `--apply`. The patched copy is saved alongside as
`~/.tweakcc/native-claudejs-patched.js`. These two files (plus the native binary
backup) are your diffing anchors when something breaks.

---

## 1. The four zeros (the completion bar)

`blocking issues: 0` is necessary but **not** sufficient. A bump is done only when
**all four** counters are zero. Stopping at the first one ships silent regressions.

1. **Smoke** — `claude --print "say only the word READY"` returns `READY`. The
   binary boots and runs.
2. **Apply hygiene** — `--apply` output is only `✓` rows plus
   `Customizations applied successfully!`: zero `✗`, zero `failed to find`, zero
   `Could not find`, zero `Conflicts detected`, zero patch `no-op` lines, zero
   `WARNING`/`ENOENT`. "Acceptable noise" is the wrong framing — every warning has
   a root-cause fix or is downgraded to debug output.
3. **No orphan overrides** — the version-bump report's
   `prompt overrides not in JSON` is `0`. Every override `.md` maps to a live
   prompt id in the new JSON.
4. **No latent var breakage** — the orphan-`${VAR}` validator reports
   `UNKNOWN_N placeholders: 0` and `unbound labels: 0` across every override, AND
   the mis-bind audit (`node tools/auditMisbinds.mjs`) exits 0. (The one standing
   benign exception is `data-anthropic-cli`'s `${VERSION}` — see §15.)

Why all four matter: smoke alone is a boot-only check. Many failure modes (a
mislabeled override slot, a lazily-rendered TUI path, a conditional prompt that
never materializes at boot) pass the smoke test and only crash — or render wrong
content — later. `READY came back` is not `the bump is complete`. Smoke should
also exercise key post-patch UI paths (`/config`, `/theme`, `/help`), not just
boot — see §7.

---

## 2. Bug class: patch failed to find (regex anchor drift)

**Symptom.** During `--apply`: `patch: <name>: failed to find <pattern>`.

**Cause.** A code-patch in `src/patches/*.ts` anchors a regex on a minified-but-
stable shape that CC's new build changed: the bundler renamed an identifier, OR
Anthropic refactored the surrounding code, OR the feature the patch gated on got
promoted past that gate (the anchor literal is gone entirely).

**First decide which case you are in** by grepping the freshly extracted `cli.js`
for the anchor literal the patch keys on:

- **Matches present, regex still fails** → the shape changed. Add a new match
  method as the **first** attempt in the patch's match function
  (`// Method N: <description>`), keeping the older methods as zero-cost fallbacks
  for older CC versions. Don't delete old methods unless the old shape is gone
  from every CC version the tool supports.
- **Zero matches for the anchor literal** → the feature was promoted; Anthropic
  took over the gating. The right fix is a graceful no-op, not a regex hunt:

  ```typescript
  if (!file.includes('"the_anchor_literal"')) {
    console.log(
      'patch: <name>: feature already promoted in this CC build — no-op'
    );
    return file;
  }
  ```

**How to find the new shape.** Extract `cli.js` from the installed native binary,
grep for stable strings near the target (UI labels, config keys, English error
messages — these survive minification), then walk back from a unique anchor to the
function/object the patch needs. Write the regex to tolerate the same renames the
existing methods do: use `[$\w]+` for identifiers (CC's minifier emits `$` in many
names), anchor on literal punctuation (`,` `;` `{` `}`) rather than `\b` (`\b` is
slow on V8 and treats `$` inconsistently).

Also check the patch's `condition` in `src/patches/index.ts` before chasing regex
drift — a conditionally-skipped patch passes the four-zeros and smoke while silently
dropping a feature (e.g. a patch gated to NPM-only installs does nothing on a native
install). A vanished feature with a _clean_ apply is often a `condition` problem,
not a regex problem.

**A third cause with no shape change at all: a fixed DISTANCE between two shapes.**
A regex of the form `A(?=[\s\S]{0,N}B)` stops matching the moment Anthropic lands
unrelated code between `A` and `B`, even though both are byte-identical to the
previous build. CC 2.1.235 broke `toolsets`/`writePrintToolsFilter` this way: it
matched `let X=F(S)` and required `tools:X,refreshTools:()=>F(G())` inside a
2,500-character lookahead, MCP-prewait code landed between them, and the gap became
2,672. The fix is not a bigger window — it is to invert the anchor. Match on
whichever side is genuinely **unique** (here the use site), then derive the other by
search: once `X` and `F` are pinned, the nearest preceding `let X=F(S)` is correct at
any distance and no constant needs maintaining. A fixed-size window between two
shapes is a countdown, not a match.

This one is also a reminder that `--apply` is not the witness for every patch: a
config-gated patch never runs there. `pnpm test:pristine` — every registered write
function against a real bundle, toggles ignored — is the only check that sees it.

---

## 3. Bug class: Could not find system prompt (override pristine/ccVersion drift)

**Symptom.** During `--apply`: `Could not find system prompt 'X' in cli.js`.

**Cause.** The pristine regex for an override (built from the pieces in
`data/prompts/prompts-<ccVersion>.json`) doesn't match the running binary. Either
the override's `ccVersion:` frontmatter is older than the binary's actual CC
version, or the binary's prompt content diverged from what the JSON says.

**Fixes.**

- **`ccVersion:` is stale** → bump it to the binary's version and re-apply. Don't
  blindly bump without reading the pristine diff first (see §10).
- **Pristine pieces genuinely don't match the binary** → open the prompt id in
  `prompts-X.Y.Z.json`, grep its distinctive content against `cli.js`. If it's
  truly absent, the prompt was removed — archive the override (see §10, "removed").
- **Pristine matches but the generated regex escapes something wrong** → look at
  `buildSearchRegexFromPieces` in `src/systemPromptSync.ts`. Common culprits:
  non-ASCII chars, newlines (needs a `(?:\n|\\n)` alternation), backticks inside
  code blocks.

---

## 4. Bug class: CommonJS wrapper crash / template-literal escaping

**Symptom.** After `--apply`, launching `claude` errors with
`TypeError: Expected CommonJS module to have a function wrapper. ...` (native
install) or a raw syntax error inside `cli.js` (NPM install).

**Cause.** A prompt override emitted a string into a JS **template literal**
(backtick) whose unescaped backslashes or backticks broke template parity —
prematurely terminating the literal and leaving the rest of `cli.js` as floating
syntax. Anthropic stores prompts using a mix of single-quoted, double-quoted, and
backtick delimiters; each has different escape semantics, and override content must
be re-escaped for the _specific_ delimiter it lands in (see §8).

**How to debug.**

1. Diff the patched `cli.js` against `~/.tweakcc/native-claudejs-orig.js` and
   `~/.tweakcc/native-claudejs-patched.js`.
2. Find the patched span; look for unbalanced backticks, unescaped backslashes, a
   lone `${` with no closing `}`.
3. The fix lives in the per-delimiter escape logic: `src/patches/systemPrompts.ts`
   (the per-delimiter branches) and `escapeDepthZeroBackticks` in
   `src/systemPromptSync.ts`. Backslash-doubling is scoped to single/double-quote
   contexts; template literals get a separate parity-aware backtick-escape pass.

**Related distinct cause — stale Bun bytecode.** Bun caches compiled bytecode
alongside `cli.js`. If `--apply` writes new JS but doesn't invalidate the cached
bytecode, Bun re-runs the OLD bytecode and emits a similar error. The `clearBytecode`
flag handles this — make sure it's threaded through any new code path that mutates
`cli.js`.

---

## 5. Bug class: ReferenceError VAR is not defined (orphan placeholder)

**Symptom.** `--apply` is clean, but `claude` crashes on launch with
`ReferenceError: VAR is not defined`.

**Cause.** An override references `${VAR}` (a template interpolation) but `VAR` no
longer exists in the binary's runtime scope. Anthropic refactored the prompt and
inlined the variable as literal text, but the override still treats it as an
interpolation.

**Detection.** Run the orphan-`${VAR}` validator after every CC version bump and
every override edit. It cross-references each unescaped `${VAR}` in the overrides
against the pristine `identifierMap` for the current `ccVersion`. Don't defer the
fixes — an empty-string `identifierMap` entry (an `UNKNOWN_N`) is a latent
ReferenceError; read `cli.js` for the surrounding context, name the captures, and
fix the override in the same session.

**Per-orphan resolutions.**

- Swap to the new variable name Anthropic now uses.
- Replace `${VAR}` with the literal value Anthropic inlined.
- Escape as `\${VAR}` if the override author wanted a literal placeholder — but
  **only** when the prompt is stored in a backtick template literal. If it's stored
  in a single/double-quoted string, `${VAR}` is already inert literal text and
  escaping it corrupts the content (see §8 and §15).

---

## 6. Bug class: mis-bind (override resolves to a wrong-but-valid var) + the auditMisbinds gate

**Symptom.** None at apply, none at smoke. `--apply` is clean, the binary boots,
and the override renders **valid-but-wrong content** — or `${LABEL(N)}` becomes a
call on a string and throws a `TypeError` only when CC reaches that line.

**Cause.** Override placeholders are resolved **positionally**: a human-readable
label (`${SOME_NAME}`) maps to a slot in the prompt's `identifierMap`, and that slot
binds to whatever minified var actually sits there in the binary. Two ways this goes
wrong:

- **Partial map.** Our `identifierMap` names _fewer_ slots than the binary uses, so
  a reused label binds to a wrong-but-valid slot. Real case: a tool description's
  `${CANCEL_TIMEFRAME_DAYS}` resolved to a _function_ (a different slot) instead of
  the day-count number, so the rendered text read "auto-expire after `function …`
  days." No crash; invisible to the four-zeros (the lazy tool description never
  materializes at boot) and to the `UNKNOWN_N` validator (the override hardcoded or
  dropped the unnamed slots instead of leaving `${UNKNOWN_N}`).
- **Slot shift.** Anthropic added identifier slots to an existing prompt; carried-
  over labels stay attached to their old slot numbers, but those slots now point at
  different minified vars. `${OUTPUT_FORMAT_FN(N)}` that used to land on the
  formatter function now lands on a template-literal _string_, so at runtime
  `<string>(N)` throws `TypeError: ... is not a function`.

**Prevention.** The extractor takes upstream's complete `identifierMap` for every
_shared_ prompt (any prompt upstream also ships whose `identifiers` array matches
ours), gated on the `TWEAKCC_UPSTREAM_JSON` env var pointing at upstream's published
prompts JSON. Upstream labels every slot, so a shared prompt's placeholder lands on
the slot it means with no per-prompt curation — a mis-bind is structurally
impossible for shared prompts. Only net-new prompts (upstream lacks them) use our
generated names.

**Detection — the auditMisbinds gate.** `node tools/auditMisbinds.mjs` (run in the
driver's `check` and as part of the four-zeros) exits 1 on any finding: for every
override, every placeholder it _uses_ must sit at the same `identifierMap` slot as
upstream's complete map. This is stronger than a `named < distinct-slots` count
check — it catches **complete-but-mislabeled** maps too (where the count matches but
labels sit at wrong slots), which a count check never flags. Dump upstream's JSON
first so the audit has a reference; it skips gracefully when no upstream reference
is available.

**Fix.** Adopt the complete `identifierMap` for that prompt — name all slots in the
extractor's new-prompt assignments (see §9), confirming the `identifiers` array
matches upstream's first — then realign the override against the corrected slots. A
slot-shift fix uses an assignment matcher anchored on text unique to the new shape,
supplying the _entire_ new `identifierMap` (every slot, named correctly).

---

## 6b. Bug class: a dedup claim checked against pristine instead of the deployed override

**Symptom:** none. The apply is clean, the four zeros hold, the mis-bind audit exits 0 and smoke
passes. Information is simply missing from what the model receives.

**Cause.** An override is trimmed on the reasoning _"sibling Y already conveys this claim"_ — but
the agent read **Y's pristine text** (from `data/prompts/prompts-X.Y.Z.json` or from `cli.js`),
and Y's own override had already trimmed that sentence out. Overrides **replace** pristine, so
coverage exists only in the deployed body.

**The three cases.** Before accepting any coverage claim, establish which one Y is in:

| Y's override file      | What reaches the model                      | Covers?                              |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| exists, has a body     | **only that body** — pristine is irrelevant | only if that body carries the claim  |
| exists, body **empty** | nothing; Y is suppressed                    | **never**                            |
| **no file**            | Y's pristine, verbatim                      | yes — pristine coverage is real here |

**The circular variant.** If trims and wipe-merges run over the same batch, a trim can cite a
sibling that the same run emptied. Observed twice in one release: A dropped a rule citing B while
B was suppressed citing A. Net result — nothing anywhere carried the rule.

**Prevention.**

1. **Order the passes.** Resolve wipe-merges _before_ the trims that might cite them, so a cited
   sibling's state is settled when it is cited.
2. **Adversarially verify.** After any trim pass, re-check every trim whose rationale cites a
   sibling, with the verifier instructed to _refute_ and required to open the cited sibling's
   **deployed** `.md`. Measured hit rate on one release: 34 sibling-citing trims, **5 wrong (15%)**
   — from agents that were otherwise rigorous and quoted the covering sentence verbatim. The
   verbatim quote is exactly what makes the bad ones convincing.
3. Never accept a negative `grep` as proof of absence (a NUL byte in a file makes grep return
   false-empty for every pattern); confirm with python.

**Detection after the fact.** For each suppressed or heavily-trimmed prompt, take the claim it
used to carry and search the _deployed_ override set for it. If the only hits are in the prompts
JSON and not in any `.md` body, the claim has left the build.

---

## 6c. Bug class: an override that empties or trims a STRUCTURAL prompt

Two prompts are consumed by CC's own code, not only by the model. Emptying or trimming one
passes every static gate, because the failure is at runtime or at the API — not in the file.

**(a) Dropped injection site.** CC fills some prompts with `String.replace("<tag>", …)`, which
**no-ops silently** when the tag is absent. `skrabe/lobotomized-claude-code#2` was the empty-body
form: the auto-mode classifier prompt shipped blank, and every bash call in auto mode failed with
`<model> is temporarily unavailable`. CC 2.1.221 hit the subtler form — a trim kept 6.7KB of prose
but deleted `<permissions_template>` and `<cross_session_messages_rule>`, so the classifier
silently stopped receiving the user's configured allow/deny rules while `auto-mode defaults` kept
printing rules (those tags live in the prompt's _second part_).

Gated by `tools/checkSubstitutionTags.mjs`, in `driver check`. It discovers tags from the binary
rather than hardcoding them, so a tag Anthropic adds is covered the run it appears. Only the
string-literal form is collected: every regex-form `.replace` in the bundle parses **model
output** (`<analysis>`/`<summary>` extract the compaction result, `<thinking>` strips classifier
reasoning), where a prompt that defers to the schema's owner legitimately carries no tag —
collecting those produced 16 false positives against 3 real findings.

**(b) Suppressing a prompt that renders before the dynamic boundary.** `dda()` splits the system
array on `__SYSTEM_PROMPT_DYNAMIC_BOUNDARY__` and stamps everything before it
`cache_control.scope:"global"` — Anthropic's cross-user shared cache. The billing header holds
`system[0]` and one of three fixed identity strings (the "You are Claude Code…" set) holds
`system[1]`, which keeps the global block at `[2]`. Suppress the identity override and `[1]` goes
empty, the global block slides up, and **every interactive request fails**:

```
400 cache_control.scope: "global" is only valid when every preceding block is also globally scoped
```

Apply is clean, four-zeros green, every set PASS, `driver check` HEALTH PASSED — and `--print`
succeeds, because SDK mode takes a different identity variant and keeps the ordering valid. Only a
live **interactive** turn sees it. Content in that block is unconstrained (a proxy that swaps
arbitrary text into `[2]` still gets 200), so never chase this as a content bug. Treat every id
landing before the boundary as un-suppressable: rewriting is fine, emptying is not.

**Verifying either one costs a live turn — take it in a throwaway scratch repo.** Resuming a real
session to test relaunches that session's background jobs; on 2026-08-05 a verification turn
restarted a sandbox-bypassing job mid-task.

## 7. Bug class: code patch applies clean but crashes a lazy UI path (capture-group lesson)

**Symptom.** A regex-replace patch in `src/patches/*.ts` applies with 0 errors and
the binary boots (smoke = READY), but a lazily-rendered TUI path crashes — e.g.
`/config` dies with `undefined is not an object (evaluating '<map>[...]')`.

**Cause.** The code-patch analog of the override mis-bind. Real case: the themes
patch used a **non-capturing** prefix group `(?:return|[$\w]+=)`, but the writer
read `objMatch[1]` as the assignment prefix. That capture was `undefined`, so the
prefix defaulted to `'return'` and a theme-map assignment `hM3={...}` got rewritten
to `return{...}` — destroying the binding. `/config` then crashed reading the now-
undefined map. The four-zeros and a boot-only smoke missed it because `/config` is
never materialized by `claude --print READY`.

**Detection.** Any patch that reuses a regex group via `match[N]` in its writer MUST
capture that group. Grep `src/patches` for first-groups written as `(?:…)` whose
match index is read downstream. Add a regression test per patch asserting the
binding/structure it depends on survives the rewrite. Smoke must exercise `/config`,
`/theme`, `/help`, not just boot.

**Fix.** Make the reused group capturing — `(return|[$\w]+=)` — so the writer
preserves the real assignment prefix. That prefix is **platform-specific** (the
theme-map name differs per minify target; see §14) — never hardcode it; always read
it from the live capture.

---

## 8. The quote-context rule (delimiter decides whether to escape a placeholder)

The delimiter a prompt is stored in inside `cli.js` decides whether `${VAR}` is a
live interpolation or inert literal text — and therefore whether it must be escaped.

- **Backtick template literal** → `${VAR}` **interpolates** at runtime. The var
  must exist in scope (else §5's ReferenceError), and a literal `${...}` you want
  to survive must be escaped `\${...}`. Backslashes and backticks in override
  content must be parity-escaped for the template (else §4's wrapper crash).
- **Single- or double-quoted string** → `${VAR}` is **inert literal characters**.
  There is no interpolation and no ReferenceError is possible. **Do not escape it** —
  escaping pushes a literal backslash into the content (the double/single-quote
  escape pass doubles it), corrupting whatever the model reads (e.g. an install
  command or an MCP-config example).

To tell which delimiter a prompt uses, grep `~/.tweakcc/native-claudejs-orig.js`
for the `var <ID>=` assignment that precedes the prompt's content. The first
character after `=` (`` ` ``, `'`, or `"`) is the delimiter. The patcher's escape
logic is per-delimiter for exactly this reason (§4): override content destined for
one delimiter is re-escaped to survive _that_ delimiter's parser.

---

## 9. Fuzzy-carryover miss & NEW_PROMPT_ASSIGNMENTS

**The extractor's carryover.** When you re-extract prompts for a new CC version, the
extractor seeds names from the _previous_ version's `prompts-<prev>.json` by fuzzy-
matching on the **first ~100 chars** of each prompt's reconstructed content. Always
seed from **our own** previous JSON, never from upstream's — different naming
conventions produce mass fuzzy-misses.

**The miss.** If Anthropic edited a prompt's _opening_ (a rename, or wrapping it in
a `${flag()?A:B}` conditional), the fingerprint changes and the carried name
silently drops — the prompt extracts **anonymous**. This looks identical to a real
removal but is not one. To distinguish, grep the "removed" id's _distinctive
content_ against the freshly extracted `cli.js`:

- **0 hits** → genuine removal → archive the override (see §10, "removed").
- **hits present** → fuzzy-miss → restore the name with a `NEW_PROMPT_ASSIGNMENTS`
  entry, then re-seed and re-run the extractor.

**NEW_PROMPT_ASSIGNMENTS** (in `tools/promptExtractor.js`) maps a content matcher to
a name/id/description (and, for a slot fix, a complete `identifierMap`). It's used
for two things: restoring fuzzy-missed names, and naming **genuinely new** prompts.
High-confidence naming of new prompts via this map is allowed automatically — but
prompt _content_ and the corresponding override edits need explicit sign-off (see
§16). Before naming a new prompt, dig the binary for its identity: registration
function, model-invocation gating, skill frontmatter. Place newer-shape entries
_before_ older fallbacks in the array, since the lookup returns the first match.

**No-regression bar.** Print prev-named / current-named counts. The current named
count must not drop below the previous unless each dropped id is **verified gone**
from `cli.js` (a fuzzy-miss looks exactly like a removal — confirm by grepping
content). See §15 for the upstream-comparison angle.

---

## 10. The override-realignment recipe (bump / retrim / resync / rename / inline / removed / suppress)

After the new prompts JSON lands, `--apply` may report
`Conflicts detected for N system prompt file(s)` — overrides whose pristine drifted
(their `ccVersion:` is older than the prompt's current version). The overrides still
_apply_ (0 `Could not find`); the conflict is advisory: "the pristine you tuned
against has moved — review." Drive it to **0 conflicts**. **Read every diff** —
bumping `ccVersion:` without reading the pristine-old → pristine-new diff is the lazy
path and silently keeps stale content. Classify each:

- **Trivial drift** (whitespace, a conditional wrapper a full-replacement body
  supersedes, a removed example) → **mechanical ccVersion bump** of the `.md`
  frontmatter. The target version comes from the prompt's `version` in
  `prompts-X.Y.Z.json`.
- **Real content change** (Anthropic added/removed a meaningful section, OR
  rewrote/reformatted the prompt) → **re-trim the override against the NEW pristine**
  in the override's established style, keeping every load-bearing
  command/path/field/error-tag and cutting prose. A rewrite/reformat is the same
  class: **always re-trim, never keep old-flow/old-format content.** Keeping stale
  content is a silent correctness bug — it applies warning-free and passes smoke
  while injecting now-wrong instructions. (Distinguish from a mechanical bump: if the
  override is still a valid leaner-than-latest trim and Anthropic only _added/reworded_
  detail, a ccVersion bump is enough; if Anthropic _replaced_ the flow the override
  describes, you must re-trim.)
- **Renamed id** — the content survives under a new id. `git mv` the override to the
  new id and bump its `ccVersion:`. Confirm by grepping distinctive content from the
  override body in the new JSON.
- **Inlined id** — the prompt's content was merged into a larger prompt. Archive the
  override; the parent prompt's override likely already carries the inlined content.
- **Removed id** — distinctive strings from the override appear nowhere in the new
  JSON. Archive the override (move it to an `orphans-removed-for-X.Y.Z/` dir);
  recoverable from there or git history if the feature returns.
- **Prompt split into shared constants** — a combined prompt's sub-sections move to
  shared `var`s referenced by both inline cells and a bundled workflow. Trim the
  parent override to its shrunk pristine, populate the new split ids with the
  reshaped sub-sections, and leave the bundled `workflow-script-*` override pristine
  (it references the same constants — DRY propagation).
- **Suppress a prompt** — keep its `.md` present with an **empty body**. Do NOT move
  the file away: `syncPrompt` auto-recreates a pristine `.md` for any JSON id lacking
  one on the next `--apply`, so a moved-away override comes back. An empty body is the
  intended suppression signal.

After realigning, re-run the health check → 0 conflicts.

---

## 11. The three override surfaces (named-prompt, inline-blob, system-reminders)

There are **three** distinct override targets — it's easy to reshape one and forget
the other two on a model-card pass:

1. **Named-prompt overrides** — one `.md` per prompt id in `prompts-X.Y.Z.json`.
   These carry `ccVersion:` frontmatter and resolve placeholders against the
   `identifierMap`.
2. **Inline-blob overrides** (`inline-*.md`) — content spliced into a larger blob,
   not standalone prompts in the JSON. They use **positional** remapping of `${...}`
   interpolations / array identifiers (the patcher binds them to whatever the binary
   carries at apply time). A naïve orphan-`${VAR}` scan flags their minified idents
   (`${H}`, `${GJH}`) as unbound — **false positives**: don't check inline-blob
   overrides against the named-prompt `identifierMap`.
3. **System-reminder overrides** (`system-reminders/*.md`) — a registry of code-
   patch-injected reminder bodies. Each has a vanilla `defaultBody`; an empty body
   suppresses the reminder. These are prompts too: on a model-card reshape, diff each
   `<id>.md` body against its `defaultBody` and judge each one against the new model's
   behavior, just like the named prompts.

---

## 12. Stale-backup downgrade gotcha

**What bites.** `claude update` pulls a new pristine binary, but the tweakcc backup
(`native-binary.backup` + `native-claudejs-orig.js` + `native-claudejs-patched.js`)
stays on the OLD version. `--restore` then copies the OLD binary over the new one →
a **silent CC downgrade**. `--apply` also restores-from-backup-first for native
installs, so it downgrades too.

**Fix.** When the CC version actually changed, **`rm`** the stale backup trio — `rm`,
not `mv` to a `.stale-*` archive (archiving stacks up hundreds of MB of slop over a
few bumps, and `--apply` re-extracts from the live binary anyway). The driver's
health check flags this condition before it can bite.

**Backup-vintage trap.** Grepping the native _binary_ backup for a version pattern
returns a bundled-lib version, NOT CC's version. Read the vintage off the extracted
`native-claudejs-orig.js` instead.

---

## 13. Commit-message bad-substitution gotcha

**What bites.** `git commit -m "…${VAR}…"` in zsh/bash **expands `${...}` and
backticks inside the double-quoted message** → `bad substitution` → the commit
silently doesn't happen. Pipeline commit messages are full of `${VAR}`, `${?...}`,
and backticked code, so this fires constantly.

**Fix.** Write the message to a file and use `git commit -F /tmp/msg.txt`. Verify
afterward with `git log -1`. Commit each logical change separately (prompt sync,
patch fix, README bump, override realignment) with descriptive messages.

---

## 14. Platform-minified names differ per target

CC ships as Bun-compiled native binaries, and **the same `cli.js` source is minified
to different identifier names per target** (darwin-arm64 vs linux-x64 vs linux-arm64,
etc.). The same source-level variable gets a different minified name on each platform.
Anything that hardcodes one platform's minified name — a `${VAR}` in a template
override, a bare identifier in a raw-passthrough array body, a `${EXPR.method()}`
inline expression, or a captured assignment prefix in a code patch — will crash the
_other_ platform with `ReferenceError: VAR is not defined`,
`Cannot access 'J' before initialization`, or a named-prompt regex that matches one
platform's pristine but not the other.

The patcher handles this with **positional remapping**, not hardcoded names:

1. Inline-blob template overrides — captures the pristine template's `${...}`
   expressions in order, rewrites the override's positional placeholders to whatever
   the binary actually carries.
2. Inline-blob array raw-passthrough overrides — a JS-aware tokenizer finds free
   identifiers in the pristine array body and positionally rewrites the override.
3. Named system-prompt regex builder — when a piece contains a complex inline
   `${...}`, the builder substitutes a `\$\{[^{}]*\}` wildcard before escaping, so the
   pattern matches any single-level interpolation regardless of the minified name.
4. System-reminder case-body wrappers — discovers the array-wrapper / message-
   constructor / feature-gate identifiers from the existing body rather than
   hardcoding them.

**Consequence for the bar.** A clean apply on one platform does not prove valid
emission on another — only a smoke test on that platform does. If you patch on more
than one OS/arch, **every** platform must smoke green before the work is complete.
Never hardcode one platform's minified name anywhere — in an override or a code patch.

## 15. Upstream comparison: extractor canonical, no count regressions, the data-anthropic-cli VERSION false-positive

**Our extractor is canonical.** Do not merge upstream and do not pull upstream's
prompts JSON into the tree. Fetch upstream as a **comparison signal only**:
`git show upstream/main:data/prompts/prompts-X.Y.Z.json > /tmp/upstream-X.Y.Z.json`,
then compare named-count and id-sets against your freshly extracted JSON. Cherry-pick
a single upstream data file or one-off fix only if it materially beats ours.

**Two things to verify against upstream each bump:**

- **No count regression.** The named-prompt count must not drop versus the previous
  version unless every dropped id is verified absent from the current `cli.js` (a
  fuzzy-rename miss, §9, looks identical to a real removal). Compare against upstream
  to catch coverage gaps.
- **Per-prompt identifierMap adoption.** Where upstream's `identifierMap` for a
  specific prompt is fuller or fresher than ours (and its `identifiers` array
  matches), adopt upstream's map for that prompt and realign the override — that's
  how mis-binds (§6) are prevented for shared prompts. Don't wholesale-rename the
  whole corpus to upstream's vocabulary: override names are keyed to **our** JSON's
  `identifierMap` by human-readable name, so a mass rename to a different vocabulary
  breaks every override against our JSON. The underlying vars are positional captures
  — names are ours, slots come from upstream.

**The data-anthropic-cli `${VERSION}` false-positive.** On every bump the orphan-var
validator flags `data-anthropic-cli`'s `${VERSION}` as UNBOUND (its `identifierMap`
is empty). This is **benign — never escape it.** The prompt is stored in a
_double-quoted_ string in `cli.js`, so `${VERSION}` is inert literal shell-var text
(a placeholder the user fills when downloading the CLI), not a JS interpolation — it
cannot throw a ReferenceError. Escaping it would double the backslash and corrupt the
install docs the model reads. This generalizes (§8): **a `${UPPER_SNAKE}` flagged
UNBOUND is benign iff the prompt is stored in a single/double-quoted string** — grep
`~/.tweakcc/native-claudejs-orig.js` for the `var <ID>=` assignment and check the
delimiter; only a backtick template literal can actually interpolate. Count these as
benign; leave them untouched.

## 16. New-prompt naming: high-confidence auto-name vs content sign-off

When a CC bump introduces genuinely new prompts (no previous-version entry to fuzzy-
match), two different things have two different bars:

- **Naming** — assigning a high-confidence id/name/description via
  `NEW_PROMPT_ASSIGNMENTS` is allowed **automatically**, _provided_ you've grounded
  the identity in the binary first: read the registration function, any model-
  invocation/disable gating, the injection model, and skill frontmatter. The matcher
  keys on text from the raw template-literal source. Don't guess a name from a single
  snippet — dig until the identity is unambiguous.
- **Content / override edits** — writing or reshaping the _override body_ for a new
  prompt requires **explicit user sign-off**. Never autonomously write an override
  for a new prompt or decide its lobotomization on your own. Present the full context
  (what the prompt does, how it's gated, how it's injected) and propose names; let the
  user approve before you commit override content.

The split exists because a wrong _name_ is a cheap rename, but a wrong _override body_
silently changes what the model is told — and (per §6) can pass the four-zeros and
smoke while rendering wrong content on a lazy path.
