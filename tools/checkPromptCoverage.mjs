// Prompt-coverage gate: does OUR catalogue carry every model-facing string a
// reference catalogue found?
//
// Why this exists. The showtime no-regression bar compares NAMED COUNTS — ours
// (3771) vs upstream's (644) — which passes unconditionally and so can never
// see a miss. It is also blind by construction to the real failure mode: Claude
// Code ships MORE THAN ONE description for the same tool on different code
// paths, and two extractors each find a different one. `refreshmcptools` is the
// worked example — we catalogue "Re-query the tool lists…" and upstream
// catalogues "Re-queries the tool list…", same tool, same version, both live in
// the binary, and the id-level diff shows nothing wrong.
//
// So compare by CONTENT, and let the BINARY arbitrate:
//   in reference, in our binary, not in our catalogue  -> MISSING   (exit 1)
//   in reference, not in our binary                    -> not ours  (info)
//
// Two traps this had to be built around, both of which produced confidently
// wrong numbers on the way here:
//
//   1. The bundle stores non-ASCII as `\uXXXX`. Reference bodies are decoded
//      text. Probing the bundle with a run containing an em-dash — which most
//      of these bodies have — fails for every one of them. Probes are therefore
//      split on non-ASCII and only pure-ASCII runs are used.
//   2. Interpolations. A body's literal text is only the pieces between
//      `${...}` slots, so probes are split there too.
//
// Usage:
//   node tools/checkPromptCoverage.mjs <ours.json> <reference.json> <pristine cli.js>
// Exit 0 = no gap.

/**
 * Collapse both escape conventions onto one key so catalogues written in either
 * can be compared.
 *
 * A reference catalogue may store pieces in RAW JavaScript source form — `\"`,
 * `\\`, the bytes as they sit in cli.js — while ours stores them COOKED at
 * quoted sites: `"`, `\`, the text the model actually reads. That difference is
 * by design and it is not a one-way decode, because a decode that is right for
 * the raw side destroys a genuine backslash on the cooked side (`use
 * Anthropic\Bedrock\MantleClient` is real prompt text, not an escape).
 *
 * Dropping every backslash is symmetric and settles it: raw `\\B` and cooked
 * `\B` both key to `B`, raw `\"` and cooked `"` both key to `"`. Slightly
 * lossy — two texts differing ONLY in backslashes would key alike — which is
 * the right trade for a presence check whose question is "do we carry this text
 * at all". CORPUS side only: probing the BINARY keeps the raw form, since raw
 * is what the binary contains.
