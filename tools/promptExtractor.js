// contorted to `${SENDMESSAGE_TOOL_NAME}` for the same line, which rendered
// CORRECTLY only because the map was wrong. Fix the map; the overrides then use
// names that mean what they say.
// An id may need more than one variant: the mislabel recurs whenever Anthropic

//
// The inherited minLength=500 floor (Piebald, #115) silently drops every prompt
// shorter than 500 chars. A 2026-06-16 classification of the ~1100 sub-500
// strings the floor was eating found ~425 are genuinely model-facing (system
// reminders, tool/param descriptions, short system-prompt fragments) — exactly
// the override surface the floor was hiding. The other ~675 are user-facing UI
// (error toasts, tooltips, --help) or internal (thrown errors, logs, config
// schemas). The decisive signal is the EMISSION SITE, not the prose.
//
// Rather than reproduce the bundler-minified drop contexts (console/throw/JSX
// factory names change every CC version and per platform — a maintenance trap),
// we keep the floor as the default gate (so junk stays dropped by construction)
// and lower it ONLY for strings carrying a STABLE, non-minified model-facing
// signal: (a) lead-in context Anthropic controls semantically (the JSON-schema
// tool/param shape, descriptionForModel, tool-result text), and (b) content

// prompts, collision-checked against the drop set).
